# WaveVM Kernel Accelerator Specification

Status: proposed implementation specification.

Scope: the optional `wavevm.ko` / `/dev/wavevm` accelerator, per-VM kernel
contexts, IOCTL and mmap boundary, context lifetime, cache publication,
concurrency, failure behavior, and migration from current global module state.
The user-space node runtime remains the semantic authority; memory, vCPU,
identity, manifest, and capability semantics are defined by their corresponding
specifications.

This specification is normative for new Mode A work. It defines an accelerator
for the canonical Mode B semantics, not a second distributed control plane.

## 1. Goal and Non-Goals

The goal is for an available kernel module to accelerate selected local
data-plane operations without changing VM identity, routing authority, page
version rules, vCPU handoff semantics, lifecycle ownership, or error meaning.

```text
candidate/admitted user-space manifest + capability profile
  -> explicit wvm_kernel_ctx create/attach
  -> manifest-derived cache/configuration prepare
  -> optional local acceleration
  -> typed completion through the same node-runtime contract
```

Mode A is therefore:

```text
Mode B canonical runtime + optional per-VM kernel acceleration
```

### 1.1 Release priority

Per-VM context isolation is a minimum usable system gate. A host may decline
Mode A when the module or kernel cannot provide it, but it must not advertise
multi-VM Mode A while state, request IDs, mappings, route caches, or teardown
remain singleton-owned.

The full accelerator specification also describes later hardening such as
complete fault-path migration and exhaustive worker-failure testing. Those
items improve the accelerator but do not make the no-module Mode B baseline a
second-class path.

### 1.2 Implemented Migration Boundary

The current tree implements the admission boundary and the first
context-scoped data-plane state migration, but not the complete per-VM
kernel-context migration:

- `IOCTL_WVM_QUERY_CAPS` reports the context-binding ABI and the current limit
  of one concurrent Mode A context per physical module instance.
- `IOCTL_WVM_BIND_CONTEXT` and `IOCTL_WVM_UNBIND_CONTEXT` bind an open
  `/dev/wavevm` descriptor to the manifest identity, VM incarnation,
  manifest generation, capability profile, and activation fence.
- Manifest-gated master, QEMU frontend, and KVM executor descriptors bind the
  same context before using the accelerator.
- The explicit kernel context now owns the accepted identity, epoch cache,
  registered RAM slots, mapping lock/pointer, and IRQ wait state. VMA fault and
  write-protect callbacks resolve that context from the mapped file, and
  asynchronous invalidation and dirty-commit work carries its context pointer.
- The request ID pool and request completion table are allocated and released
  through the context. Their wire ID format and per-CPU allocation behavior are
  unchanged; this is an ownership migration, not a serialization change.
- The page metadata radix tree and its lock are context-owned. Fault insertion,
  invalidation, dirty commit, direct push, and kernel RPC batch lookup use the
  same context tree; RCU lookup and reorder-queue behavior remain unchanged.
- Kernel `logic_core` VM namespace construction uses a context accessor.
  `g_my_vm_id` is not a production identity authority and must be removed
  from the final context-bound path.
- A different VM identity is rejected while the current module-global state is
  still active. Field-by-field legacy IOCTL setters are not a supported
  configuration path and must be removed as the typed context ABI is enabled.

This boundary is still an admission guard, not proof that the old kernel
`logic_core` semantic state, route tables, page metadata, request state,
socket/transport, or shared queues have already become context-owned.
Multi-VM Mode A remains unsupported until those states are migrated and the
isolation acceptance tests pass.

Non-goals for V1:

- Requiring the module, root, or a custom kernel for a correct Mode B VM.
- Making a module-global socket, VM ID, route table, mapping, or request table
  authoritative for all VMs.
- Letting kernel code allocate VM identity, choose placement, admit members,
  create a route, or own a VM lifecycle transition.
- Direct kernel-to-arbitrary-remote-executor traffic that bypasses local and
  remote node runtimes plus the sidecar/gateway fabric.
- Creating a fresh semantic VM context for each `open()` of `/dev/wavevm`.
- Replacing normal asynchronous queues, batching, QoS, and bounded backpressure
  with global synchronous kernel calls just to pass a test.

## 2. Authority and Capability Boundary

| State or decision | Authoritative owner | Kernel role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VM ID, incarnation, manifest digest/generation, activation fence, lifecycle | User-space control plane and admitted manifest | Validate and cache one accepted snapshot. |
| Route topology and next hops | Control-plane route snapshot | Cache/use one complete derived snapshot only. |
| Page directory, version, copyset, and commit result | User-space node runtime/directory | Accelerate local capture/invalidate/wakeup only. |
| vCPU ownership, handoff sequence, context schema | User-space node runtime/QEMU contract | Optionally accelerate local context transfer/run mechanics. |
| KVM object and TCG helper lifecycle | Local executor/QEMU | Do not create a second executor authority. |
| Kernel context handle and its references | Kernel module | Enforce isolation and lifetime for attached local callers. |

The capability report in `capability-fault-engines.md` is the only basis for
selecting Mode A. A loaded module is not automatically selectable. The report
must include the accelerator ABI version, supported context-schema versions,
per-VM context capability, feature bits, limits, and the current module/device
instance identity.

## 3. Per-VM Context Model

### 3.1 Context Identity

One `wvm_kernel_ctx` represents the kernel acceleration state for exactly one
`{vm_id, vm_incarnation, physical_node_id}`. It is created explicitly from a
prepared per-node runtime manifest and has an opaque kernel-issued context
handle plus an attach capability. The attach capability is not a raw `vm_id`
or a user-chosen integer.

```text
wvm_kernel_ctx {
    context_handle;
    attach_capability;
    refcount;
    state;

    vm_id;
    vm_incarnation;
    admission_tx_id;
    eligibility_fence_digest;
    activation_fence;
    physical_node_id;
    expected_node_instance_id;
    manifest_digest;
    manifest_generation;
    capability_profile_digest;
    route_snapshot_key;

    immutable_config_snapshot;
    ram_mapping_registry;
    page_or_dirty_acceleration_state;
    vcpu_acceleration_state;
    request_and_completion_state;
    local_sidecar_transport_binding;
    workqueues_and_pending_operations;
    attached_fd_and_role_records;
}
```

Every new mmap, context-bound IOCTL, page/dirty callback, wait queue, and
context-tagged worker item resolves a live context first. The remaining legacy
request, route, page-metadata, socket, and shared-queue paths are explicitly
not yet context-scoped and remain behind the one-context admission limit.

### 3.2 Context State Machine

| State | Meaning | Allowed next state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEW` | Allocated but has no accepted manifest snapshot. | `PREPARING`, `DEAD` |
| `PREPARING` | Candidate manifest/capability/configuration is being validated. | `PREPARED`, `QUIESCING`, `DEAD` |
| `PREPARED` | Exact candidate snapshot and local resources are ready; no guest traffic yet and prepared state may expire without activation. | `ACTIVE`, `QUIESCING`, `DEAD` |
| `ACTIVE` | Matching activation fence promoted the candidate; manifest-bound acceleration may accept operations. | `QUIESCING`, `FAILED` |
| `QUIESCING` | New work is rejected; owned work is drained or given a typed failure. | `DETACHING`, `FAILED` |
| `DETACHING` | Mappings/FDs are being detached after no new work can enter. | `DEAD` |
| `FAILED` | Accelerator cannot safely continue. | `QUIESCING`, `DEAD` |
| `DEAD` | Context is unpublished and final references are released. | none |

Closing one file descriptor removes only that attachment and its reference. It
does not destroy the context while other authorized QEMU, node-runtime,
executor, or control-plane descriptors remain. The lifecycle coordinator
initiates `QUIESCING`/destroy after VM teardown, not whichever process closes
first.

### 3.3 Attachment and Permission Model

`CREATE_CTX` is available only to the local manifest/lifecycle authority or an
explicitly delegated local control endpoint. It verifies the prepared manifest,
expected node instance, eligibility-fence digest, accelerator capability profile,
prepared reservation lease, and node role assignment before returning a handle.

`ATTACH_CTX` requires all of:

- Opaque context handle and attach capability.
- Matching manifest digest/generation and VM incarnation.
- A role permitted by the per-node manifest, such as QEMU frontend, node
  runtime, or a designated local executor.
- Local credential/peer validation defined by the deployment. File-system mode
  bits alone are not sufficient when an unrelated local process could attach.

The exact credential transport may be a protected local control socket,
inherited sealed descriptor, or another explicit local mechanism. It must not
be a hardcoded shared token or a raw global `vm_id` write.

## 4. IOCTL and mmap ABI

The current numeric IOCTL definitions are not the production configuration ABI.
The context ABI uses typed envelopes from `wire-ipc-abi.md`; each
request includes context handle, manifest identity, operation ID, payload
length, flags, and typed result status.

### 4.1 Required ABI Groups

| Group | Operations | Required semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery | `GET_CAPS`, `GET_ABI_VERSION` | Read only; returns module/device instance and capability limits. |
| Context lifecycle | `CREATE_CTX`, `ATTACH_CTX`, `DETACH_CTX`, `QUIESCE_CTX`, `DESTROY_CTX` | Explicit state transitions and refcount rules. |
| Configuration | `PREPARE_MANIFEST`, `COMMIT_CONFIG`, `QUERY_CONFIG` | Accept complete manifest-derived snapshots; no independent truth injection. |
| RAM/mapping | `REGISTER_RAM`, `UNREGISTER_RAM`, `QUERY_MAPPING` | Register only manifest-authorized QEMU RAM ranges and ownership metadata. |
| Acceleration | `CAPTURE_DIRTY`, `FAST_INVALIDATE`, `REMOTE_RUN`, `WAIT_IRQ`, `FAST_LOCAL_FORWARD` | Typed accelerator operation tied to one context/request/fence. |
| Diagnostics | `QUERY_OPERATION`, `QUERY_STATS`, `FAULT_INJECT_TEST_ONLY` | Bounded observability; test injection is build/test gated and cannot alter production semantics. |

`PREPARE_MANIFEST` validates the complete candidate
identity/capability/configuration snapshot but does not use it for guest
traffic. `COMMIT_CONFIG` requires the lifecycle activation fence and atomically
publishes one immutable snapshot after user-space activation. A partial
series of `SET_VM_ID`, `SET_ROUTE`, `SET_GATEWAY`, `SET_MEM_LAYOUT`, or epoch
writes must not be a new production configuration path.

### 4.2 Legacy IOCTL Classification

| Current legacy IOCTL family | Migration role |
| --- | --- |
| `IOCTL_WVM_REMOTE_RUN` | Context-bound acceleration of a validated vCPU handoff; not an independent remote execution protocol. |
| `IOCTL_SET_MEM_LAYOUT` | Compatibility adapter for manifest-authorized RAM registration only. |
| `IOCTL_WAIT_IRQ` | Context-bound local interrupt wait/notification with typed timeout/error result. |
| VM ID, epoch, route, placement, gateway setters | Deprecated field injection. Replace with complete derived manifest/route snapshot prepare/commit. |
| `IOCTL_RPC_SYNC_ACK` | Remove or assign a typed owner before stable ABI exposure; an unhandled numeric command is not a semantic feature. |

No IOCTL may accept a raw route target for nonzero VM traffic and then infer
identity. All route targets retain VM/incarnation scope as defined by
`identity-routing.md`.

### 4.3 mmap Rules

An mmap is valid only for a context-attached, manifest-authorized RAM or
explicit accelerator buffer region. The mapping registry records:

```text
MappingRecord {
    context_handle;
    manifest_digest;
    gpa_range;
    qemu_ramblock_identity;
    host_mapping_identity;
    access_permissions;
    mapping_generation;
    attached_vma_reference;
}
```

The module rejects overlapping mappings that belong to a different VM context
or a stale manifest. VMA close decrements only the mapping/context reference.
Teardown first blocks new mappings and new operations, then drains references,
invalidates/unregisters ranges, and finally frees context memory. A stale user
mapping must never resolve through a newly created VM with the same raw ID.

## 5. Data-Plane Rules

### 5.1 Memory and Dirty Acceleration

The kernel may capture dirty ranges, invalidate a local cache/mapping, or wake
a local waiter only when the operation names a valid context, page/range,
operation ID, and required memory fence. It may not:

- Declare a memory commit successful before the user-space directory records
  the idempotent result required by `memory-consistency.md`.
- Install page bytes from another VM/context.
- Retain a page/route cache after its manifest, incarnation, or generation is
  invalidated.
- Convert a dirty-capture failure into an empty successful journal.

KVM Mode A retains the same prohibition on using host `PROT_NONE` as a guest
RAM trap. Kernel dirty capture is an acceleration provider, not permission to
change KVM's page-resync semantics.

### 5.2 vCPU and Interrupt Acceleration

`REMOTE_RUN` accepts only a node-runtime-validated handoff with a current
`{vm_incarnation, vcpu_index, handoff_sequence, operation_id}` and successful
memory fence. The kernel returns one typed completion or in-progress/result
query state; it cannot execute the same handoff twice after a lost reply.

`WAIT_IRQ` and wakeups are local acceleration primitives. QEMU remains the
guest interrupt/device authority, and the node runtime owns delivery identity,
watermarks, and cross-node transport. A kernel wakeup is not proof that a guest
IRQ has been injected or that a remote device operation completed.

### 5.3 Sidecar/Gateway Boundary

All production cross-node traffic still follows:

```text
local QEMU/executor -> local node runtime -> local sidecar -> gateway fabric
                    -> remote sidecar -> remote node runtime -> executor
```

An optional `FAST_PACKET_TX` or `FAST_LOCAL_FORWARD` accepts a complete,
already validated node-runtime envelope and may only deliver it through the
manifest-bound local sidecar transport binding. It cannot select a remote
executor, create a route, strip VM identity, bypass the remote node runtime, or
turn one kernel socket into global routing truth.

## 6. Concurrency, Locking, and Backpressure

The implementation must use context-scoped queues and references. A module-wide
worker is permitted only when every queued item holds a live context reference
and cannot mix request namespaces.

Required lock order when more than one is needed:

```text
context registry lock
  -> context lifecycle lock
  -> immutable configuration publication/read lock
  -> mapping registry lock
  -> per-vCPU / per-page / per-request lock
```

The registry lock is held only for lookup/publication. Network transmission,
QEMU callbacks, user-space waits, allocation that can block, and workqueue
flushes must occur after releasing locks that would block context teardown or
another VM's independent work.

- Context state is checked before and after acquiring a long-lived operation
  reference.
- Per-page and per-vCPU locks are never used as a module-global VM lock.
- Queues have documented bounds and QoS. Overload returns a typed backpressure
  result or pauses the affected operation at a safe boundary; it must not drop
  vCPU, dirty, IRQ, or memory completion work.
- Config/route snapshot replacement uses one complete immutable object per
  context. Readers use an old or new complete snapshot, never a field-by-field
  mixture.

## 7. Failure, Teardown, and Fallback

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Module absent/unavailable before admission | `PREFER` resolves to Mode B if valid; `REQUIRE_KERNEL_ACCEL` rejects before start. |
| Create/attach/configuration validation fails | Reject local lifecycle prepare; no partially configured global state remains. |
| Eligibility or activation fence mismatch | Reject prepared/active operation; no kernel context may promote itself from a listener or process lifetime. |
| Context worker fails or device disappears | Mark context `FAILED`, reject new acceleration, and report typed status to user-space lifecycle. |
| One attached process exits | Drop only its role/FD reference; retain context while other references/lifecycle require it. |
| Quiesce deadline expires | Return outstanding operation identities/status; do not free mappings or reuse context identity while work might reference it. |
| Context destroy | Require lifecycle teardown, no active mapping/operation references, and complete removal from registry before freeing. |
| Route/configuration generation mismatch | Reject operation and request user-space refresh; never use a nearby/global cached entry. |

Mode A failure after a VM begins running is not permission to continue with
undefined state. V1 pauses or fails the affected VM according to the memory and
vCPU contracts. A future hot fallback to Mode B requires a quiesced,
manifest-validated transition that proves no dirty, handoff, or interrupt state
is lost.

Until explicit contexts, context-scoped mappings/requests, and teardown tests
are implemented, capability discovery must advertise a single concurrent Mode
A VM per physical node. Admission must reject a second Mode A VM even if two
processes can currently open `/dev/wavevm`.

## 8. Current Code Mapping and Known Deviations

| Current file or symbol | Current behavior | Required migration direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `master_core/kernel_backend.c` | Holds the explicit single-context registry, context-scoped identity/epoch/RAM/mapping/IRQ state, and legacy accelerator paths. | Move remaining page metadata, route, request, socket, and shared-queue state into context-owned or explicitly context-tagged structures. |
| `master_core/module-common.[ch]` | Shares module utility/state definitions. | Keep only module-wide registries/workers that carry an explicit context reference. |
| `common_include/wavevm_ioctl.h` | Defines legacy IOCTL numbers and payloads. | Introduce versioned context lifecycle/configuration/operation envelopes while retaining adapters during migration. |
| Remaining globals such as `g_socket`, `gateway_table`, route tables, and shared queues; `g_my_vm_id` is now only a compatibility mirror | Can still act as singleton state for one module instance. | Move into context-owned state or replace with derived immutable cache; remove the mirror after legacy setters are retired. |
| `wavevm-qemu/accel/wavevm/` | Opens `/dev/wavevm` and uses accelerator hooks. | Create/attach only through the local prepared manifest and validate context identity for each operation. |
| `master_core/logic_core.c` / node runtime | Owns current user-space packet and request handling. | Remain semantic authority; kernel completion returns to this contract rather than inventing a parallel RPC path. |

## 9. Compatibility and Migration

1. Inventory every module-global variable, IOCTL, mmap path, workqueue item,
   wait queue, socket, request cache, and teardown path.
2. Add read-only capability discovery and reject unsupported multi-VM Mode A
   before changing data-plane behavior.
3. Implement explicit create/attach/detach context lifecycle while adapting
   legacy setters to a complete manifest-derived configuration object.
4. Move mappings, page/dirty metadata, vCPU state, route cache, request cache,
   and transport bindings into `wvm_kernel_ctx` one domain at a time.
5. Add context references to every asynchronous callback/work item, then make
   teardown quiesce and drain those references before freeing memory.
6. Replace field-by-field route/placement/VM setters with atomic snapshot
   publication and generation validation.
7. Enable more than one Mode A VM only after isolation, teardown, and
   semantic-equivalence acceptance tests pass.

## 10. Acceptance Tests

- Two Mode A VMs on one physical node have distinct context handles, mappings,
  route caches, page/dirty records, request IDs, wait queues, and local names;
  one VM's traffic cannot affect the other.
- Multiple QEMU/node-runtime descriptors can attach to one context, and closing
  one descriptor does not destroy active state held by the others.
- A wrong incarnation, manifest digest, capability profile, role, or attach
  capability is rejected before mmap or data-plane operation.
- Atomic configuration/route snapshot replacement never exposes a partial
  table to a concurrent reader.
- A lost `REMOTE_RUN` reply returns the documented in-progress/cached result
  without a second execution interval.
- Dirty capture/invalidation produces the same page version and handoff-fence
  outcomes as Mode B for the same workload.
- KVM Mode A does not install host `PROT_NONE` guest-RAM traps and still
  performs explicit version-gap resync before dependent execution.
- Forced worker failure and concurrent detach/destroy do not use freed context
  memory, leak mappings, deadlock unrelated VM contexts, or report false
  completion.
- Cross-node packet instrumentation proves every accelerated remote operation
  entered/exited through the node-runtime and sidecar/gateway path.
